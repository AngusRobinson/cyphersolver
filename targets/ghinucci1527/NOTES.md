# Ghinucci (Bishop of Worcester) to Wolsey, 22 July 1527 (BL Cotton MS Vespasian C IV f. 363, DECODE R8613) — tracker item #13

Status: read (9 Oct 2026). R8613, the "undeciphered" Worcester duplicate of 22 July 1527 (Ghinucci to Wolsey), deciphered to 97.9% (797 of 814 tokens) with a key recovered from the three sibling letters' contemporary decipherments (R8476, R8589, R8590, all in print). Written up as docs/ghinucci1527.html. Gilino R8572 (15 Sept 1527), formerly in this folder, is a different cipher: targets/gilino1527/. Garbino belongs to the Ranzo code (targets/ranzo1528/), not this target.

Letters and Papers iv (BHO, fetched 9 Oct 2026; L&P cites the OLD Cotton foliation, DECODE the new):

| DECODE | new f. | old f. | L&P iv | date, sender | what L&P says |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R8476 | Vesp. C III 304 | 303 | 2727 | Ghinucci to Wolsey, Poissy, 24 Dec 1526 | "Hol., Lat., part cipher, pp. 6"; printed St. P. VI 552; "2. Decipher of part of the above [R.O.], commencing 'Dominatio v. R. vidit modum' and ending 'effectum facere non posse'" |
| R8589 | Vesp. C IV 313 | 291 | 5282 | Ghinucci to Wolsey, Valladolid, 12 Feb 1529 | "Hol., part cipher"; L&P PRINTS the deciphered Latin of the whole cipher passage ("Cum animadvertissemus ... plus brevitatis quam moræ hec mors afferet"); item 2 = Vesp. C VII 40, endorsed "1529, translata e cifris" |
| R8590 | Vesp. C IV 315 | (315) | 5300 | Ghinucci to [Wolsey], Valladolid, 15 Feb 1529 | quotes the interlinear decipherment ("Legeram enim quod in meis particularibus literis cifris additum fuerat ... perbecta essent") |
| R8613 | Vesp. C IV 363 | 332 | 3291 item 2 | Ghinucci to Wolsey, 22 July **1527** (heading "Dupplicata sub die 22 Julii 1527") | "Duplicate of the preceding, partly in cipher, undeciphered." Item 1 = Vit. B IX 127, Lat., mutilated, summarised in English (Imperialists want to split England from France; Avemaria offered 3,000,000; Tarbes; 1,000,000 for the children; envoy to free the Pope; rumour Wolsey goes to France to split the English and French Church from Rome) |
| R8572 | Vesp. C IV 214-218 | 199 | not found | Gilino, Paredes [de Nava], 15 Sept 1527, Italian, to Francesco II Sforza | different system (Sforza key R5258); now `targets/gilino1527/` |

So: R8589 and R8590 are a known-plaintext pair each (decipherment printed / interlined); R8476 has a contemporary
decipher (R.O.) and is printed in State Papers VI (1849) 552; R8613 is the only Worcester letter that nobody
deciphered (L&P: "undeciphered"). DECODE date for R8613 (1529) is wrong: 22 July 1527.

Tomokiyo's note "Sylvester Darius ... f.260, DECODE R8589" uses R8589 for a different folio; R8589 is f.313.

Blocker (2026-09-15): DECODE records exist but images are "Authentication required / Private Ciphertext";
BL's digitised-manuscripts viewer is unreliable since the 2023 attack; Gallica blocks this client. Without the
page images there is nothing to transcribe. If access is obtained: transcribe base-letter+superscript tokens,
seed with the R8590 deciphered fragments (Latin syllables), and extend by Latin LM + cribs (Charles V's court at
Valladolid, 1529; Wolsey as addressee).

## 9 Oct 2026: system established, R8613 transcribed

- System (from R8589 aligned with the L&P 5282 plaintext, and the R8590 interlinear): syllabic substitution,
  base glyph = consonant row, superscript digit = syllable in the row (vowel order differs per row, homophones);
  bare glyphs = single letters (bare o = p, bare z = t ...); many nulls, which the contemporary decipherer of
  R8589/R8590 struck through with a light diagonal stroke. Details and values: `key.md`, `key.tsv`.
- R8476's cipher (24 Dec 1526) is printed in full in St. P. VI 552-556 (italics = deciphered; collated with the
  contemporary R.O. decipher). Its alignment is being done to enlarge the key (`r8476_tokens.txt`).
- R8613 (f.363, the undeciphered duplicate of 22 July 1527) transcribed in full: `r8613_tokens.txt` (2 pages,
  45 lines, ~760 cipher tokens). The copy is a clerk's clean hand with no strike marks, so nulls are unmarked.
- First pass with the R8589 key (`python decode.py r8613_tokens.txt`) already gives Latin: "Lautrec",
  "Avemaria", "apud nos", "quia redire", "pro certo tenerent", "dilationem", "perpetuam divisionem" -- matching
  the L&P summary of the Vit. B IX original (Avemaria, Lautrec, perpetual division from Rome).

## 9 Oct 2026: R8613 key extension by context (pass 1)

Values added from R8613's own context, each confirmed in at least one other place where possible
(see `key.tsv` evidence column): S=u, o8=du, e3=co, n2=Caesar, n_=s, V=i, q2=be, d5=mi, x4=lo, n3=ga,
a(bare)=d, h(bare)=o, [=b, m=r, e9=cu, d2=mu, e6=ca, C=o, Cd=o, d+=m, q+=a, w(‒ω)=f, z+=t, plus nulls
(y7, g8, V13, o19, y6, q3, v18, p3, p7, Q8, T14, x18, p4 ...).
Readings secured so far (all agree with the L&P 3291 summary of the Vit. B IX original):
- "unionem inter [..] non diu duraturam" (P1 l9-10)
- "ut aliquam ansam dimit[t]atur qua possint ipsi aut nos semper ad colloquia redire. Saepeque apud nos instant
  ut particulariter super hoc apud consiliarios(?) Caesaris tamquam ex nobis instemus, ostendentes satis aperte
  cupere se magnopere ut tractatus omnino ... concludatur" (P1 l13-17)
- "per Avemariam diebus preteritis tres milliones obtulisse Caesar Nobis dixit" (P1 l18-19)
- "a fine sue commissionis dixit de Lautrec in discessu ipsius fratris sibi dixisse quod non erat parcendum pro
  liberatione filiorum ... usque ad millionem ... numquam antea fuisset oblatum minus millione. Sed ... nullo modo
  videtur verisimile quod de uno tantum millione Lautrec ageret, sed potius de millione ultra id oblata"
- "quod Nobis innuit Caesar, videlicet fuisse petitam longam dilationem ad illos tres milliones ... solutionemque(?)
  dividendam in plures pagas"
- "putant eum qui a Caesare ad[..] mittitur in nulla habere commissionem super eius liberatione ... et hic
  divulgari ad obturandum ora obloquentium tam hic quam alibi de detentione"
- "D.V.R. veniat in Galliam curaturam inter alia ut ecclesia [Anglicana] et [Gallicana] a Romana separetur non
  quidem durante captivitate et ad ... liberationem, ut dicitur, sed ad perpetuam divisionem"
Open: P1 l1-8 (the opening: Imperialists, separation of England from France, conditions) and scattered tokens.

## DECODE queue

- R8476 (Vesp. C III f.304): language of clear and cipher is Latin, not English; date 24 Dec 1526, Poissy; sender
  Girolamo Ghinucci, Bishop of Worcester, to Wolsey; L&P iv 2727; full text with the deciphered passages printed in
  State Papers Henry VIII vol. VI (1849) pp. 552-556 (contemporary decipher in the Record Office). Status could be
  "Decrypted (printed)". Transcription and alignment: `r8476_tokens.txt`.
- R8589 (Vesp. C IV f.313, old f.291): Latin; Ghinucci to Wolsey, Valladolid 12 Feb 1529; L&P iv 5282, which prints
  the Latin decipherment of the whole cipher passage; a contemporary translation "translata e cifris" is Vesp. C VII
  f.40. The MS itself carries the decipherer's null strokes. Transcription: `r8589_tokens.txt`.
- R8590 (Vesp. C IV f.315): Latin; Ghinucci to [Wolsey], Valladolid 15 Feb 1529; L&P iv 5300; interlinear
  decipherment on the page.
- R8613 (Vesp. C IV f.363, old f.332): date is 22 July **1527** (heading "Dupplicata sub die 22 Julii 1527"; the
  "1529" is the binder's heading), not 1529; sender Ghinucci, to Wolsey; L&P iv 3291 item 2 ("partly in cipher,
  undeciphered"); the original is Cotton Vitellius B IX f.127 (mutilated). Reading and key from this project:
  `r8613_reading.txt`, `key.tsv`, token transcription `r8613_tokens.txt`.
- R8572 (Vesp. C IV ff.214-218): a different cipher, queued under `targets/gilino1527/`.
- The four Worcester records could be linked as one key family; R8581 (Darius, Vesp. C IV f.289) is the record
  Tomokiyo cites as "R8589".

## 9 Oct 2026: R8476 aligned, R8613 deciphered (pass 2)

- R8476 (f.304r-v) transcribed and aligned with St.P. VI 552-556 by a sub-agent: 845 cipher tokens, 251 distinct,
  42 struck nulls (all align as nulls). Output `r8476_tokens.txt`, `r8476_key.tsv`. It confirmed the row values
  and gave the code words: L8 Regia Majestas, K5 Rex Gallorum, K6 Italia, n2 Cesar, x1 Hispania, y6 Pontifex,
  d4 Gallia, mm9 Orator Pontificis, mm1 videtur, U6/o6 habere, Yp4 expeditionem, ɔ7 D.V.R. and others.
  Known conflicts in the scribe's own usage (two glyph forms collapsing in my names): m = r / x (x in "ex"),
  r = s / m, tw = m / r, # = s (R8476) vs o (R8590, R8613), h = s (R8476) vs o (R8613).
- With those codes R8613 now reads (`r8613_reading.txt`): 814 cipher tokens (`r8613_cipher.txt`, measured), 34
  unread (4.2%), i.e. ~95.8% of tokens given a value that reads as sense in context; several single readings are
  marked (?) and rest on one occurrence. The content agrees point by point with the L&P 3291 summary of the
  mutilated original Vit. B IX f.127 (Imperialists want to draw the King to themselves and part him from the
  French king; they think the amity will not last; the French offered 3,000,000 through Avemaria; the friar's
  account of Lautrec's order not to spare money for the French king's sons, "usque ad millionem"; the Emperor's
  hint of a long respite for paying the three millions in instalments ("in plures pagas"); the Imperial envoy to
  the Pope has no commission for his release; the rumour that Wolsey goes to France to separate the English and
  French church from Rome "non quidem durante Pontificis captivitate ... sed ad perpetuam divisionem").
- Prior solution: none for R8613 (L&P: "undeciphered"); the summary of the original (L&P 3291) was known before
  the attempt and was used as a context check; the Latin plaintext of the cipher passages is new.

## Remaining gaps

- R8613 P1 l1 "[..1] habere cupere, ho[..2]" (c; b t7) - blocker: open-codes; single occurrences, no sibling letter has these tokens and the original (Vit. B IX f.127) is mutilated and not imaged.
- R8613 P1 l7 "oblatis eis [..1]" and l11 "cupere [..1]" (the "." mark; Q8) - blocker: too-short; one token each, Q8 is a null elsewhere and nothing fixes a value here.
- R8613 P1 l8 "[..3] ad venirent" (W14 K h) - blocker: open-codes; three tokens in one place, W14 probably a null, K/h have conflicting values between letters.
- R8613 P2 l7, l13, l16 single tokens (bn, d8, b6) - blocker: open-codes; single occurrences, no second instance in R8476, R8589, R8590 or R8613.
- R8613 P2 l19 "disseminari [..3] is(tos?)" and l22 "[..3] sed ad perpetuam" (mm19 u r; n7 c1 d4) - blocker: open-codes; single occurrences in unusual combinations, no sibling with them.

## Escalation

- [x] siblings: all four Worcester records (R8476, R8589, R8590, R8613) used. 9 Oct 2026: the DECODE neighbours of R8572 and R8613 opened by API (R8566-R8579, R8604-R8619) and the Ghinucci/Wigorn records listed (R8552-R8616): all other Cotton Vesp. C IV records are Lee/Poyntz/Worcester despatches in the English letter cipher (images of R8540, R8558, R8573, R8582, R8607 checked by eye), not this key; R8617 onward is Add MS 20443. Ghinucci's other July 1527 letters with decipherments (L&P 3273, 3321) are Record Office items, not on DECODE.
- [x] clear-pages: R8613 has no decipherment, gloss or clear copy on either page (clerk's "Dupplicata"); no "clear" or "postscript" pages on the neighbouring records.
- [x] known-keys: Tomokiyo's partial Worcester table (cryptiana henryviii.htm) and the three deciphered siblings merged into key.tsv.
- [x] print: L&P iv (BHO) for every letter, State Papers VI and VII (archive.org), Tomokiyo; R8613's original (Vit. B IX f.127) is only summarised in L&P 3291.
- [x] key-rebuild: Worcester key rebuilt from three known-plaintext letters (R8589 via L&P 5282, R8590 interlinear, R8476 via St.P. VI) and extended by context in R8613.
- [x] retry: every open R8613 token re-read on zoomed crops (pass of 9 Oct, P1 l1-11, l17; P2 l13, l17; second pass P1 l4, l6) and re-run with the extended key: "pinguiores eis" (P1 l4) and "spes nutriret" (P1 l6-7) settled, 16 tokens; 17 tokens remain.

## 9 Oct 2026: second image pass on R8613, sibling check, close

- P1 l4 re-read on a full-resolution crop: the last two tokens are p+ and ɔ10, not "p10 +?". With h1 = s (h = s as in R8476),
  u8 = o, Z9 and ɔ10 nulls, Q1 = i: "Et si pinguiores eis offerret conditiones" (parallel to l7 "oblatis eis ...
  pinguioribus conditionibus"). u8 and Q1 rest on this one place (grade C).
- P1 l6: the token read "v3" has a descender: y3 = nu. p+ a1 h xi14 y3 T Z2 K13 K9 z = s pe s - nu t - ri re t:
  "nisi hec eos spes nutriret" (h = s again; xi14 and Z2 nulls).
- Measure: 814 cipher tokens, 17 unread -> 797 (97.9%) given a value that reads as sense (`r8613_reading.txt`).
- Siblings opened by the DECODE API (above); nothing in this key besides the four Worcester records.
- Garbino (BnF Clair. 327 ff.279-280; fr. 3022 no. 20) is not this cipher: it is the Ranzo initial-letter + number code
  (`targets/ranzo1528/`, split from `targets/vasto1527/` on 14 Oct 2026). It is out of scope for this target.
- Outcome: R8613 key recovered based on plaintext from external sources (the siblings' printed and interlinear
  decipherments), 97.9%, over the read bar; the remaining tokens are scattered single occurrences.

## 14 Oct 2026: split from the combined 'superscript' target

Until 14 Oct 2026 this folder was `targets/superscript/` and also held Gilino's letter to Francesco II Sforza
(R8572), on a page "Ghinucci to Wolsey and Gilino to Sforza, 1527" (`docs/superscript.html`). George Lasry pointed
out that the two have nothing in common but superscript numbers: different writers, languages, chanceries and keys
(this Worcester syllabary, rebuilt here; the Sforza key DECODE R5258 for Gilino). Gilino's letter, its key files and
George Lasry's contributed edition moved to `targets/gilino1527/` with their own page (`docs/gilino1527.html`); this
folder became `targets/ghinucci1527/` (`docs/ghinucci1527.html`). `docs/superscript.html` now only points to both.
`mk_validation.py` and `validation.tsv` were rebuilt for R8613 alone, scored with the Latin model `la`.
